# Tagging (and Re-tagging)

This example illustrates the fundamental building block of `EngThermBase.jl`, which is
engineerign thermodynamics quantities‚Äîherein denoted as `AMOUNTS` as not to confuse with
[Unitful.jl](https://github.com/PainterQubits/Unitful.jl)'s `Quantity` unit'ed type.

First one loads the package:

```@example 1
using EngThermBase
```

then, one can either use (i) an `AMOUNTS`'s type constructor, or (ii) it's corresponding
function, or (iii) it's alias as to build a tagged amount:

## Tagging with type constructors:

All `EngThermBase.jl` amount types are 5 ASCII characters long ending with "`amt`". For
instance, the temperature type is `T_amt`:

```@setup 2
using EngThermBase
```

```@example 2
T1 = T_amt(325u"K")     # This constructor checks and converts units if necessary
```
```@example 2
T2 = T_amt(325)         # This constructor applies the type's default unit
```
```@example 2
T1 == T2
```

## Tagging with the corresponding function:

A given amount type's corresponding function is named after the first 2 characters of a type
name. The temperature, for instance, will be `T_`:

```@setup 3
using EngThermBase
```

```@example 3
T3 = T_()               # The temp. function method without arguments returns the _stdT
```
```@example 3
T4 = T_(40u"¬∞C")        # This fallsback to the appropriate `T_amt` constructor
```

## Tagging with the function alias:

`EngThermBase.jl` amount function aliases are meant to render the code more readable (closer to
mainstream engineering textbook notation) while using high- Unicode code-points (as to avoid
polluting the variable space with one-letter functions.

```@setup 4
using EngThermBase
```

```@example 4
T5 = ùóß()                # \bsansT<tab>, identical to `T_()`
```
```@example 4
T6 = ùóß(40u"¬∞C")         # Identical to `T_(40u"¬∞C")`
```
